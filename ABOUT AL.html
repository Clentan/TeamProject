                    Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.<br> These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correct. <br><br><br>
                    AI can be categorized into two types: narrow AI and general AI. <br>Narrow AI, also known as weak AI, is designed to perform a narrow task, such as facial recognition or internet searches. <br>General AI, also referred to as strong AI or artificial general intelligence (AGI), would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in a manner similar to human beings across a wide range of tasks.<br><br>
            
                    AI has applications in various fields, including healthcare, finance, transportation, entertainment, and more. It is often used to automate repetitive tasks, make predictions based on large datasets, and assist humans in decision-making processes. <br>However, there are also ethical and societal concerns surrounding the development and deployment of AI, such as issues related to job displacement, bias in algorithms, privacy concerns, and the potential for misuse.<br><br>
